		 * 1) READ THIS ENTIRE COMMENT
		 * 2) AFTER READING, YOU MAY DELETE THIS COMMENT
		 * 3) INSERT YOUR OWN CODE HERE TO CONTROL YOUR ROBOT. 
		 * 4) YOUR GOAL IS TO GET YOUR ROBOT TO THE GRAY SQUARE.
		 *
		 * Functions you can use:
		 *		moveForward(): The robot will move forward
		 * 			by one square relative to the direction
		 *			it is currently facing. If you move into 
		 *			a white square, the game continues. 
		 * 			If you move into a gray square, you win.
		 * 			If you try to move into a black square, 
		 *			you lose the game.		 
		 * 
		 *		rotateRight(): The robot will rotate to the
		 *			right relative to its current orientation.
		 * 
		 *		rotateLeft(): The robot will rotate to the
		 *			left relative to its current orientation.
		 *
		 *		goalReached(): The function returns true if
		 *			you have reached the end of the maze. It 
		 *			returns false if you are still in a white
		 *			square. This function can only be called 
		 *			100 times per maze to try to prevent the
		 *			game from crashing.
		 *
		 *		canMove(direction): This function returns true
		 *			if the robot can move in the specified direction
		 *			relative to its current orientation. Otherwise,
		 *			it returns false. You must replace the parameter 
		 *			'direction' with one of the following arguments:
		 *				'forward'
		 *				'backward'
		 *				'left'
		 *				'right'
		 *			Note: you need to include the quotes since this function
		 * 			only accepts a string as its argument.
		 *		
		 *	Other programming techniques you can use:
		 * 		-You can use iteration, such as 'for loops' and 'while loops'.
		 *		-You can define your own functions. 
		 *		-You can define your own variables.
		 *

		 /*
		  * Solve the maze by creating the following two abstractions (functions):
		  *		1. multiMove(num)
		  *			- This function takes a number as a parameter and moves forward the number of spaces given
		  *		2. roundAbout()
		  * 		- This function will complete the 360 degree turns found at each corner.  Each turn can be completed by calling this one function.
		  * Use a combination of these two functions to complete the maze and finish in the gray box.  You must travel counter-clockwise!
