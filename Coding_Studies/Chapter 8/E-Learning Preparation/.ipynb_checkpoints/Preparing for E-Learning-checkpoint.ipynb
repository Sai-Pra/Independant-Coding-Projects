    "\n",
    "You will need Anaconda on your home computer. If you have already been working on homework/projects from home, you should be all set. Otherwise, here are some links that might be helpful: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Windows: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section\n",
    "* Mac: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section\n",

    "\n",
    "### Additional Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the modules we need are included with Anaconda (over 1,500!). However, we need a few extras that are not included by default: \n",
    "\n",
    "* exifread: used to read metadata embedded in image files\n",
    "* gmaps: the Google Map API, which allows you to put pins on your own maps\n",
    "* textblob: a module for natural-language processing\n",
    "* image: used for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Install Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use *pip* to install these modules. If you already know how to use *pip*, you just need the following three commands: \n",
    "\n",
    "* pip install exifread\n",
    "* pip install gmaps\n",
    "* pip install textblob\n",
    "* pip install image\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unfamiliar with *pip*, it is a package that can download and install modules quickly/easily. If you have a Windows computer, you can click the link below to watch a video of me installing these packages on my own Windows computer. If you have a Mac or a Chromebook, I've included links from other sources that I found from doing a Google search. \n",

    "\n",
    "*Note: If you have a Mac or a Chromebook and you'd like to made a video screencast that shows/explains how to download modules, I'd love to replace the above links with your screencast. I'd be happy to award a couple extra credit points for your efforts.*\n",
