My mom Shirley Goldman lived in LTC for 3 years until she died in 2014. It would have broken my heart to not be able to visit her on #MothersDay and any other day. I'm thinking of all the families who can't visit today because of #COVID19.
It's one for the ladies. Happy #MothersDay! https://t.co/934AUTiwJk
@RealCandaceO this was low. This mom is still grieving on #MothersDay (the day she gave birth to #AhmaudArbery) and you’re using your national platform to call her son a criminal and make it easier for the men who murdered him to get off ... and you’re wrong.

Today, many countries are celebrating #MothersDay. I wish to remember all mothers with gratitude and affection, entrusting them to the protection of Mary, our heavenly Mother. Let us also remember those mothers who accompany us from Heaven.
On this special occasion, and in these disturbing #COVID19 times all around the world, I want to celebrate our teeming army of health workers, especially the mothers among them, for the selflessness, commitment and sacrifice they continue to exhibit. Happy #MothersDay to us all! https://t.co/mqlzkR5tlB
This #MothersDay, I'm sending my love to the Circle of Mothers, a group that no mother should ever––ever––have to join. Today, we grieve for their unthinkable losses, and we pledge to remember the names of their children. May their stories fuel our work for change.

The ERA was passed 45 years ago &amp; ratified by VA’s vote in Jan 2020.  On Friday, hours before #MothersDay the Trump/@GOP regime filed to  countersue to prevent the ERA from being added to the US Constitution.  Any woman who still supports Trump &amp; votes GOP silences her own voice.

Someone once told my mom she wasn’t a ‘real mom’ because she had me via C-section. FYI: She’s the realest mother, father &amp; friend ever.   Happy #MothersDay to all mamas. You’re the realest - whether you adopted, had a surrogate, etc. The mode of becoming a mom doesn’t matter.
Sending a little extra love today to all of the moms, &amp; to anyone who may be missing theirs right now. It’s nice how through my daughter, I am able to experience memories with my own mom.

It had to be a son. On brand.
The reason I haven't called you for #MothersDay is because those aren't MY kids. Why don't you ask the fathers of those ankle-biters why they haven't called? This is one of those days when I lay low. #mothersday2020
@DianaRoss Beautiful. I'm not a mother yet but one day I will be. And I can't wait to become one. Happy  #MothersDay

For #MothersDay I gave myself permission to just “let it go”. I still miss my mom, i was lucky to have her for 21 years. I was blessed enough to see my kids today, it didn’t matter where or what we did. Life isn’t like the movies, it was time to let it go.
The outlook that the child will form towards life depends a lot on the mother. His attitude, his views - religious or otherwise- his perspective on life and its goals, will all be gained from her.  Let's try to be good mothers. #MothersDay

There is no such thing as a male mother.  There is no such thing as a female father. No matter how much you insist otherwise, this is reality. Mother's Day is for mothers who gave birth to children. They were and always will be - female. https://t.co/pKIHSaOORq
Growing up, Ruth Bader Ginsburg's mother always wanted her to be a lady— and “being a lady” meant being fiercely independent. 💪 #MothersDay https://t.co/NMaRwplnM4

If you consume dairy, you support babies being taken from their moms.  These moms cried out and did everything they could to try to take back their babies.

Today, many countries are celebrating #MothersDay. I wish to remember all mothers with gratitude and affection, entrusting them to the protection of Mary, our heavenly Mother. Let us also remember those mothers who accompany us from Heaven.

This #MothersDay, I'm sending my love to the Circle of Mothers, a group that no mother should ever––ever––have to join. Today, we grieve for their unthinkable losses, and we pledge to remember the names of their children. May their stories fuel our work for change.
For my American friends, we say ‘mum’ in Canada. The guilt translates universally though.

Happy #MothersDay to @NICKIMINAJ. Remember that we are all her sons.
@RealCandaceO this was low. This mom is still grieving on #MothersDay (the day she gave birth to #AhmaudArbery) and you’re using your national platform to call her son a criminal and make it easier for the men who murdered him to get off ... and you’re wrong.

Betty: My first love is my mother. She did so much for us as children as a single parent. I watched her make a 💵 out of 15. I thought she was either a magician or she had God's actual phone #. She wasn't a motivational speaker; she was an inspirational speaker.   #MothersDay https://t.co/4ULbAfyrjb

Unpopular opinion: I wish they cancel #MothersDay and make a #ParentDay instead .. not every child has a mother and a father They might have 2 mothers, or none .. Merging them into Parent day makes more sense to me, it’s more inclusive

I am sadly joining @AliVelshi. I’m happy to speak with Ali always. But it’s #MothersDay and we will be discussing Black men who have been shot and all I can think about are all the mothers who find today deeply painful.
Happy #MothersDay to @NICKIMINAJ. Remember that we are all her sons.

This #MothersDay I learnt of a story that was carried from Lira where women who sell fruits for a living, didn't beat the curfew and were remanded to detention for failing to meet 100k bail requirement. They had babies on their backs!?!   I am still recovering!
On #MothersDay this year, let’s celebrate the creativity and resilience of our moms, many of whom are juggling work and family in challenging ways during this pandemic.  Moms, let’s allow ourselves a breather today (because you know we’ll have to be right back at it tomorrow)!

#MothersDay   Milk isn't something human animals must consume, it is the milk produced by a cow to nourish her baby which she gave birth to, not for humans. Because we take her milk away, her babies are taken &amp; sold/killed for veal. Please end this torture for mothers &amp;babies https://t.co/yzXpykf4BX

That said, when I was a little girl growing up in #India we (Christians) celebrated #MothersDay on July 26–Feast of St. Anne, Mother of Mary! Is it an indication of Indian secularism at work that the celebration Sunday has been changed.
I am sadly joining @AliVelshi. I’m happy to speak with Ali always. But it’s #MothersDay and we will be discussing Black men who have been shot and all I can think about are all the mothers who find today deeply painful.
It was written that a little girl asked her mother, "How did the human race appear?" The mother answered, "God made Adam and Eve, and they had children, and so was all mankind made."  #SpikeYourDay #MothersDay

@RealCandaceO this was low. This mom is still grieving on #MothersDay (the day she gave birth to #AhmaudArbery) and you’re using your national platform to call her son a criminal and make it easier for the men who murdered him to get off ... and you’re wrong.
This #MothersDay, I'm sending my love to the Circle of Mothers, a group that no mother should ever––ever––have to join. Today, we grieve for their unthinkable losses, and we pledge to remember the names of their children. May their stories fuel our work for change.

The ERA was passed 45 years ago &amp; ratified by VA’s vote in Jan 2020.  On Friday, hours before #MothersDay the Trump/@GOP regime filed to  countersue to prevent the ERA from being added to the US Constitution.

My first love is my mother. She did so much for us as children as a single parent. I watched her make a 💵 out of 15 cent. I thought she was either a magician or she had God's actual phone #.
