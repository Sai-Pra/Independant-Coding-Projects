A very impressive report on COVID-19 in Brazil, they have done it at state level which is IMHO a too large scale for this type of modelling   but this is what is possible with the  data available.
Drug cocktails have been effective in treating HIV/AIDS. Could they also be useful against #coronavirus/#COVID19?   New research suggests a combo of lopinavir-ritonavir (aka Kaletra), ribavirin and interferon beta-1b might help.  https://t.co/OrSqv40igf

It‚Äôs a PM‚Äòs job to make decisions. Tonight, Johnson confirmed that he won‚Äôt: he‚Äôs dumped the ownership of #COVID19 on us. That‚Äôs what the new slogan really means. If there‚Äôs a 2nd peak, it‚Äôll be on us not having stayed alert, not having controlled the virus etc. #BorisSpeech

Under the disguise of #Covid19, many innocent Baloch civilians are being abducted by Security agencies from Kech, Balochistan.   It seems that #PakArmy have started a huge operation against unarmed poor men &amp; women who are beaten up mercilessly!   https://t.co/o8Hkd2N62i
Those who ‚Äúneed to go back to work‚Äù will be overwhelmingly those in low paid &amp; insecure work. Which incidentally is over-represented by women &amp; ethnic minority grps. BME groups are disproportionately more at risk of mortality with #COVID19. Do some lives matter more than others?
So important that people understand that many #PLWNCDs are not receiving appropriate treatment during #COVID19 epidemic. Disruptions are reported in majority of countries. We are assessing the extent in all countries and will share results soon. https://t.co/bsCB1c9qBH
