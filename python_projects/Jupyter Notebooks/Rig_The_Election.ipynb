    "For context, I (Sai) at the time of writing this am a freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. In my dorm, we have a door decoration context, however, it was aparantly made to be cheated according to my Resident Advisor. This is because the google form the election is ran thoguh can be voted on multiple times, and doesnt track who submits which vote. As a result, our RA challenged our floor to try to vote our doors with the most amount of votes. This is my effort to automate this; specifically in a way to make our floor have the most votes and my door be the door contest winner."
